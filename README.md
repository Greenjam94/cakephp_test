# CakePHP Test
CakePHP is a PHP framework. They offer a [tutorial](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/tutorials-and-examples/cms/installation.html) that creates a basic content management website. This is a repo that I'm using as I follow along.

# Initial setup

`mkdir cakephp`
Get a folder for a new project

`git init`
Created a new git repo

 - added empty README.md
 - added Vagrant file for first commit
 - added remote for new github repo
 - committed and pushed while empty

## Vagrant

`vagrant init`
First thing I did was set up Vagrant.

`mkdir /setup`
Added vagrant related files:
 - bootstrap.sh (commands to prepare vm for cakephp)
 - db.sql (default sql file for initial db setup with bootstrap)
 - apache.conf (config for apache web server to work)

`vagrant up`
Getting the VM up and running to prepare for CakePHP install
Also set up .gitignore file
 - .vagrant directory: it is generated by vagrant
 be github repo
 - composer.phar: it is a file downloaded when running setup/bootstrap.sh
